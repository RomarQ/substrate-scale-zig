            Review this pull request for a Zig SCALE codec library.

            Focus on:
            1. **Correctness**: Does the code correctly implement SCALE encoding/decoding?
            2. **Zig idioms**: Does the code follow Zig best practices?
            3. **Memory safety**: Are there any memory leaks or unsafe patterns?
            4. **Error handling**: Are errors properly propagated and handled?
            5. **Test coverage**: Are new features adequately tested?
            6. **Documentation**: Are public APIs documented?

            For context, this is a SCALE codec implementation aligned with Rust's parity-scale-codec.
            Key types: Compact(T), Result(T, E), Option(T), tagged unions with scale_indices.
